## Profile

Gregg is a systems architect, software executive and entrepreneur with over 30 years of industry experience. He started three companies in Marin County, including Cafex Corporation, Xippix Inc., and Siterra Corporation. Gregg&rsquo;s skills as an engineering manager and software architect helped propel these companies to success in the fast moving Internet environment.

Gregg is currently active in the popular _Ruby_ and _<span class="caps">RDF</span>_ development communities. Staying abreast of the latest technologies has been both a personal passion and a useful tool for delivering agile, state-of-the-art systems that solve particular customer needs while optimizing design and development time.

Contributions to RDF include:

  * Championing and specifying major new changes to [RDFa Core 1.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-core/),
  * Editing the [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/) [Syntax](http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-syntax/) and [API](http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-api/) documents,
  * Reconciling [HTML5 microdata](http://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/) with RDF and publishing the [Microdata to RDF W3C Note](http://www.w3.org/TR/microdata-rdf/),
  * Implementing virtually all RDF serialization formats along with a fully compliant SPARQL 1.0 processor.

Prior to starting Cafex, in 1997, Gregg was a systems architect and software manager in several notable Silicon Valley ventures, including Next Computer, Eo Inc., and MicroUnity Systems Engineering. There he specialized in designing cutting edge operating systems development, including PenPoint, Mach and Unix.
