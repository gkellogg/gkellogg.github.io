Recently, my good friend and local traffic reporting luminary, Stan Burford, got me up in the KGO Radio Traffic helicopter on a beautiful day where I could put my Nikon D200 through it&#8217;s paces. I think you&#8217;ll enjoy the results. We&#8217;re blessed here in the Bay Area with some of the most beautiful scenery in the country. Picture can be found through the [photography page](/pages/photography) on my site, or directly [here](/galleries/Above%20the%20Bay%20Area/index.html).

The ships you see are known as the _Mothball Fleet_. They include the Glomar Explorer, famous for attempting the recovery of a Soviet Submarine during the Cold War, and the USS Iowa battleship. Other notable highlights were

  * an orbit around my house in San Rafael,
  * two passes by the Golden Gate Bridge,
  * the Palace of Fine Arts,
  * Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf, * Coit Tower,
  * San Francisco Skyline,
  * AT&T Park,
  * the Bay Bridge,
  * a shot of the KGO TV helicopter, and
  * McAfee park, home of the Oakland A&#8217;s, who you can see warming up on the field.

Thanks to Gary and Terry (reporter and pilot) for making this a most memorable experience! Gregg
