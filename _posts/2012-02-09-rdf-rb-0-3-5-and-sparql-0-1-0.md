I added some minor updates to RDF.rb and re-issued versions 0.3.5 for the [rdf](http://rubygems.org/gems/rdf) and [linkeddata](http://rubygems.org/gems/linkeddata) gems. These updates are mostly to better support HTTP content negotaion and to find appropriate readers and writers based on file extension, mime-type, and content sniffing. There are also some minor fixes to aid jRuby and Ruby 1.9.3 support.

More notably, I&#8217;ve released 0.1.0 of the \[SPARQL\]\[\] gem. The logical behavior is unchanged from the previous release, but it now includes Rack and Sinatra support to easily create middleware for a SPARQL endpoint. When used with the [Linked Data](http://rubygems.org/gems/linkeddata) gem, this includes a range of RDF serializations for `DESCRIBE` and `CONSTRUCT` queries. It also adds HTTP Accept headers to outgoing requests using `FROM` and `FROM NAMED` for RDF/XML and Turtle.

As a simple example, the [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) example in the README performs a simple query against a small repository:

    #!/usr/bin/env ruby -rubygems
    require 'sinatra'
    require 'sinatra/sparql'
    
    repository = RDF::Repository.new do |graph|
      graph << [RDF::Node.new, RDF::DC.title, "Hello, world!"]
    end
    
    get '/sparql' do
      SPARQL.execute("SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }", repository)
    end
    

A minimal SPARQL endpoint can be described as follows:

    # Sinatra example
    #
    # Call as http://localhost:4567/sparql?query=uri,
    # where `uri` is the URI of a SPARQL query, or
    # a URI-escaped SPARQL query, for example:
    #   http://localhost:4567/?query=SELECT%20?s%20?p%20?o%20WHERE%20%7B?s%20?p%20?o%7D
    require 'sinatra'
    require 'sinatra/sparql'
    require 'uri'
    
    get '/' do
      settings.sparql_options.merge!(:standard_prefixes => true)
      repository = RDF::Repository.new do |graph|
        graph << [RDF::Node.new, RDF::DC.title, "Hello, world!"]
      end
      if params["query"]
        query = query.to_s =~ /^\w:/ ? RDF::Util::File.open_file(params["query"]) : :URI.decode(params["query"].to_s)
        SPARQL.execute(query, repository)
      else
        service_description(:repo => repository)
      end
    end
    

This can be run using `ruby -rubygems example.rb`, or with `rackup` or `shotgun` as `rackup example.rb`

To load a complete to the query repository, or a full dataset including multiple context, load the repository as follows:

    repository = RDF::Repository.load("http://path-to-repo")
    

This will incur a large startup time for each request, but you can also use a persistent store such as `rdf-mongo`: repository = RDF::Mongo::Repository.new() This will instantiate a persistent MongoDB store, which can be initialized one time using RDF::Mongo::Repository.load. Subsequent instantiations will use the persistent storage, and have better query performance for larger datasets.

For a more complete implementation, see the [RDF Distiller](http://github.com/gkellogg/rdf-distiller) running at <http://rdf.greggkellogg.net/sparql> and freely available to download and modify for your own purposes.
