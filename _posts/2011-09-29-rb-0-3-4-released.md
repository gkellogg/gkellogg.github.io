After several months of gathering updates for [RDF.rb](http://rubygems.org/gems/rdf), we've released version 0.3.4 with several new features:

  * Update to BGP query model to support SPARQL semantics,
  * Expandable Litereal support, to allow further implementation of XSD datatypes outside of RDF.rb (see [RDF::XSD](https://github.com/gkellogg/rdf-xsd) gem),
  * More advanced content type detection to allow better selection of the appropriate reader from those available on the client. (Includes selecting among HTML types, such as Microdata and RDFa)
  * Improved CLI with the `rdf` executable providing access to all loaded readers and writers for cross-language serialization and deserialization.

As an example of format detection, consider the following:

    require 'linkeddata'
    RDF::Graph.load("http://greggkellogg.net/foaf.ttl")
    

should load Turtle or N3 readers if installed. This becomes more important for ambiguous file types, such as HTML, which could be either RDFa or Microdata, and application/xml, which could be TriX, RDF/XML or even RDFa.

See [documentation](http://rubydoc.info/github/gkellogg/rdf/master/frames) for more specifics on this version of RDF.rb. Note that I've attempted to incorporate suggestions for improving the documentation.

Most of the reader/writer gems have been updated to match this release, in particular [JSON::LD](http://rubygems.org/gems/json-ld), [RDF::Microdata](http://rubygems.org/gems/rdf-microdata), [RDF::N3](http://rubygems.org/gems/rdf-n3), \[RDF::RDFa\]\[\], \[RDF::RDFXML\]\[\], and [RDF::Turtle](http://rubygems.org/gems/rdf-turtle). A future update to the [linkeddata](http://rubygems.org/gems/linkeddata) gem should reference the latest versions of each, but a simple `gem update` will work too.

There is a slight semantic change for repositories to support SPARQL: a context of false should not match a variable context. This is straight out of SPARQL semantics. Repository implementors who have provided custom implementations of `#query_pattern` should check behavior against rdf-spec version 0.3.4 to verify correct operation.

Next up is a release of SPARQL implemented in pure Ruby. This gem provides full support for SPARQL 1.0 queries.
