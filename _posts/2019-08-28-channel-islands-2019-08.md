Nice to be back diving the [Channel Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Islands_(California)) on the [Truth](https://www.truthaquatics.com). This time, conditions prevented us from diving Catalina and San Clemente, but we got a day in on [Santa Barbara Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara_Island) and two on [Santa Cruz Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Cruz_Island). Conditions were so-so, but it was fun to be back with friends and in the more rugged California diving conditions.
