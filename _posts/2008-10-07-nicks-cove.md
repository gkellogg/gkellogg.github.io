[Here](http://greggkellogg.net/galleries/Nick%27s%20Cove/) are photos from our weekend at Nick&#8217;s Cove in Tamales Bay with Jen & Ty. The first 9 are from a trip I took there in 2002, well before it was restored. The rest are from the other day. The place you see in the first photo, is actually the &#8220;Big Rock&#8221; villa we stayed in, before renovation. The Warf has been completely rebuilt and extended. Still very picturesque.
