I had a great dive in the Philippines diving at [Atmosphere Resort](http://atmosphereresorts.com) in Negros Oriental and [Amun Ini](http://amunini.com) in Bohol. This was really a great opportunity for some warm-water macro-photography, and as I had not even brought a wide-angle lens, this is where I _focused_. Enjoy the [photo gallery](https://lightroom.adobe.com/gallery/7b25cc9c355b4a5dbc0e0e2c81bdd444/albums/33183a6765534ef68446718b9f2e1d66/assets).
