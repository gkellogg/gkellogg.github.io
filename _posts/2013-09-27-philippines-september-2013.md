I had a great dive in the Philippines diving at [Atmosphere Resort](http://atmosphereresorts.com) in Negros Oriental and [Amun Ini](http://amunini.com) in Bohol. This was really a great opportunity for some warm-water macro-photography, and as I had not even brought a wide-angle lens, this is where I _focused_. Enjoy the [photo gallery](http://greggkellogg.net/galleries/Philippines-2013-09/index.html).
