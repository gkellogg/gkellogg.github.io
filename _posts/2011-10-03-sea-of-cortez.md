I just returned from a week on the [Rocio del Mar](http://www.rociodelmarliveaboard.com/) diving the northern Sea of Cortez (aka the [Gulf of California](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_California)). We dove along the [Midriff Islands](http://www.oceanoasis.org/conservation/study2.html) and had great encounters with Sperm Whales and Whale Sharks, not to mention the often over-exhuberant Sea Lions. Check out the [photos](/galleries/Sea%20of%20Cortez%202011-09/index.html).
