[Pictures](/galleries/Western%20Road%20Trip/index.html) from my drive out from Florida to California moving Brother-Inlaw Jeff Katz and Bear. Pictures really start in Western Texas, with dramatic images of trains and mesas in New Mexico and Arizona, the Hover Dam, Wind Farms in California and the Mojave Airport/Spaceport.
